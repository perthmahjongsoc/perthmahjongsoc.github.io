##{#winning} Winning

###{#regular} Regular hands

--
Regular winning hands consist of four [melds] plus a pair called 眼 (eyes).
By itself, such a win is worth zero 番 _f(a/)n_ (points).
To meet the conventional threshold of three 番 _f(a/)n_ for a win,
you need to go for one of the patterns below, go for an [irregular hand],
or rely on [bonuses].
